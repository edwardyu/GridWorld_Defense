**Basics**
GridDefense is a tower defense game. The objective of the game is to stop the minions from getting to the end square. 
The start square is in the bottom left corner, and the end square is in the top right corner. They are marked by green squares. 

**Barricade**
A barricade prevents a minion from reaching that square, but it does not attack or damage the minion.

**BasicTower**
A BasicTower randomly selects a minion adjacent to it and inflicts damage to it.

**WaterTower**
A WaterTower damages a minion in all cardinal directions. (It attack squares are the same as a rook in chess.)
It is blocked by barricades and other towers.

**FireTower**
A FireTower damages all minions adjacent to it.

**MageTower**
A MageTower damages all minions adjacent to it, usually killing it instantly.

**MoneyHut**
A MoneyHut generates money. It is an investment, and does not attack or damage minions.
